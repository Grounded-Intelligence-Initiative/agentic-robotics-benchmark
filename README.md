# Agentic Robotics Benchmark

**A benchmark of agentic robotics tasks for autonomous agents.** Each task drops an autonomous
agent into a sandboxed robotics problem (develop a controller, plan a manipulation sequence,
design a part or a mechanism, write code-as-policy, tune a planner, …) and scores **whatever
artifact it leaves** in `/home/user/submission/` — a controller process, a plan or planner, a
URDF / mesh / parameter design, generated code, a report — with a **hidden grader on hidden
seeds**. `verify/` scores the artifact however the task author decides; `oracle/` is the
reference artifact that scores full. There is one kind of task; `direction` (control,
planning, navigation, …) is the taxonomy axis.

The tasks run on the upstream **ALE engine**
([AgentsLastExam/ale](https://github.com/AgentsLastExam/ale)), pinned as the submodule at
`vendor/ale`; nothing here reimplements it. Upstream's
[task-authoring.md](https://github.com/AgentsLastExam/ale/blob/main/docs/specs/task-authoring.md)
and
[task-quality-standard.md](https://github.com/AgentsLastExam/ale/blob/main/docs/specs/task-quality-standard.md)
are the authority on the task format and the quality bar; this repository documents only what
the robotics domain adds. Leaderboard, task pages and the contribution upload:
<https://agentic-robotics-benchmark.org>.

This repository is public and complete: every task folder is here whole, `oracle/` and
`verify/` included. The anchor is hidden from the *tested agent* by the engine's stage
isolation while it works, not from people.

*[中文说明](README.zh-CN.md)*

## One task = one folder

A task is a self-contained `core/v1` folder that the engine runs in three stages
(`setup` → `agent` → `verify`); `oracle/` stands in for the agent under `ale validate`.
What the robotics domain adds (the three verify patterns, scoring, the vendored kit, the
probe wire) is in [`tasks/README.md`](tasks/README.md); the file-by-file tour of the
template is [`templates/README.md`](templates/README.md).

```
tasks/<direction>/<slug>/
├── task.yaml         the manifest (strict core/v1); invisible to the agent
├── instruction.md    the prompt — the only thing the tested agent is told
├── image/Dockerfile  the environment; final stage FROM an official ALE base
├── setup/            trusted root, before the agent: stages setup/payload/ into the agent home
├── oracle/run.sh     produces the reference artifact; `ale validate` runs it in place of the agent
└── verify/           the grader (verify.py), anchor.json, grader_config.json, and the
                      vendored robotics_grader/ package; ABSENT while the agent works
```

What keeps the grader and the anchor away from the agent is **timing, not a flag**: a
stage's folder reaches the sandbox only when that stage runs, `/opt/ale` is root-only, and
the agent's solver runs at the agent's UID. Nothing the agent prints is ever a scoring
input; the grader computes the metric from its own simulator state.

## Scoring

```
ratio  = clamp(measured / anchor, 0, cap)     # inverted for lower-is-better metrics; cap = 1.5
reward = clamp(ratio / full_at, 0, 1)         # the single gated reward key
```

The **anchor** is the reference implementation's own measured value from a real run —
never a printed figure from elsewhere — and `full_at` is the ratio at which the reward
saturates, sized from the metric's measured seed-to-seed spread. The capped `ratio` is the
leaderboard number; `reward` is the engine's gated signal. Metrics are always outcome
metrics on a positive scale, never wall-clock time or throughput.

`ale validate` runs every task twice. An untouched sandbox must produce an exact all-zero
verdict, and the oracle must then score exactly 1.0 on every reward key. Either miss fails
validation (`untouched_nonzero`, `oracle_not_full`; exit 2). A null anchor fails the same
way by design; `harness/ale_onboard.py` reads the run records and reports it as
`needs_anchor` with the measured value.

## Contributing a task

Two ways, one result: a pull request into this repository that adds your task folder at
`tasks/<direction>/<slug>/`, where `<slug>` is the manifest's `name` and `<direction>` its
`metadata.direction`.

1. **Open the pull request yourself.** Fork the repository, copy your folder to that path,
   push a branch and open the pull request.
2. **Upload on the website.** Download the template zip from
   <https://agentic-robotics-benchmark.org/contribute>, build the task, zip the folder and
   upload it with a title. The server prechecks it (the engine's `ale lint` plus the domain
   checks) and a bot opens the same pull request for you.

Either way CI runs `ale lint`, the domain lint and the kit comparison on the pull request, a
maintainer re-runs `ale validate`, merges, and exports the registry. The short version is
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md); the whole path, from the template to a merged task,
is [`docs/contributing-a-task.md`](docs/contributing-a-task.md).

## Layout

```
vendor/ale/                     upstream engine (submodule, pinned commit) — do not reimplement it
tasks/<direction>/<slug>/       the tasks (today: control/drone_hover)
tasks/README.md                 the task contract (source of truth for the task form)
templates/task/                 ONE template, gates green as shipped (null anchor by design)
templates/README.md             the template, file by file
identity-history.json           past (spec_hash, content_digest) pairs per task (registry v2)
shared/robotics_grader/         canonical verify-stage kit; each task vendors a byte-identical copy
harness/
  ale_onboard.py                `ale-onboard`: instantiate the template + run the real gates
  export_run.py                 `ale-export`: pack `ale run` episodes into a leaderboard bundle
  bundle_crypto.py              tar -> zstd -> age envelope shared by exporter and verifier
  redact.py  trajectory.py  integrity.py   value-pattern redaction, canonical bytes + sha256
scripts/
  export_registry.py            registry v2 from the engine's own loader (task identity)
  lint_domain.py                domain lint (what `ale lint` cannot know), placement included
  build_template_zip.py         the website's template download (zip + GETTING-STARTED.md)
skills/onboard-*/SKILL.md       agent-facing onboarding skills (router + one per verify pattern)
tests/                          pytest suite (fixtures under tests/fixtures/engine_run/)
docs/                           architecture, security model, submission format, contributing,
                                evidence/ (real verdicts, isolation audit), dev/ (design records)
.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml the checks every pull request gets
```

Never run `ale validate` on `drone_hover` casually: its oracle trains PPO and the run takes
hours. The template validates in seconds.

## Access

Running a task needs the **ALE engine** and the **ALE base image**. The engine repository
([AgentsLastExam/ale](https://github.com/AgentsLastExam/ale)) is public; it is not on PyPI
and has no license file yet, so reference it, never vendor its code into this repository or
its downloads. Install per its README (`git clone`, `just bootstrap`, `uv run ale --help`;
needs `uv`, `just`, Docker). The base image `ghcr.io/agentslastexam/container-ubuntu22-base`
refuses anonymous pulls; `images/build.sh container-ubuntu22` in the engine checkout builds it
locally in a few minutes. A contributor runs `ale lint` and `ale validate` themselves before
opening or uploading a pull request; a maintainer re-runs them before merging.

## History

This repository was created on 2026-09-07 with a fresh history when the project was renamed
from "ALE Robotics" to the Agentic Robotics Benchmark. It replaces two archived repositories:
`ale-robotics-benchmark-private` (the maintainers' task repository; the pre-ALE task form and
its harness are at its tag `legacy-harness-final`) and `ale-robotics-benchmark` (the public
mirror, tag `legacy-v0.5-final`). Nothing here revives either.

## Conventions

Everything written into this repository — code, comments, docs, task files — is **English**;
it is read by tested agents and benchmark users worldwide. Where a document and the code
disagree, the code wins: say so and fix the document.

## License

Apache-2.0 (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and [`NOTICE`](NOTICE)). The upstream engine under
`vendor/ale` is a separate project with its own terms.
