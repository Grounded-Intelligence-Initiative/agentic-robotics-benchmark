# CLAUDE.md · working conventions for agentic-robotics-benchmark

> **The Agentic Robotics Benchmark is an agentic-robotics benchmark: autonomous agents solve
> robotics problems inside a sealed sandbox.** Each task drops an agent into a robotics
> problem (develop a controller, plan a manipulation sequence, design a part, write
> code-as-policy, tune a planner, …) and scores **whatever artifact it leaves** in
> `/home/user/submission/` with a hidden grader on hidden seeds. The contract is
> artifact-general: `verify/` scores the artifact however the author decides, `oracle/` is the
> reference artifact that scores full. Never frame the benchmark as "running a policy"; that
> is one shape among many. There is **one kind of task**; `metadata.platform` (one of the fixed
> keys in `tasks/platforms.json`) is the taxonomy axis. The tasks run on the upstream
> `AgentsLastExam/ale` engine, pinned as a submodule at `vendor/ale`. **Never reimplement
> anything the engine does.** This repository is public. The user-visible name is always the full "Agentic Robotics Benchmark"; "ALE
> Robotics" is the name it had before 2026-09-07 and appears only where history is explained.

## Read this first

- **Authority for the task shape and quality: the upstream specs**,
  `vendor/ale/docs/specs/task-authoring.md` and `task-quality-standard.md` (public:
  https://github.com/AgentsLastExam/ale/blob/main/docs/specs/). Our docs state only the
  robotics deltas and link there; never paraphrase the specs at length.
- **Our deltas:** `templates/README.md` (the task contract, file by file: the verify
  patterns, the closed_loop wire, scoring); `tasks/README.md` is only a note on the worked
  example. **Design records** (dated; their 2026-10-15 notes say what no longer
  holds): `docs/dev/20260902-engine-run-submission.md` (task form, registry; its leaderboard
  bridge is retired) and `docs/dev/20260902-contribute-download-upload.md` (its website
  download and upload channel are retired).
- **Docs vs code: code wins.** If a document (this file, `PROGRESS.md`, `docs/`) disagrees
  with the code or `git log`, trust the code, say so, and fix the document.
- **Everything written into the repository is English** — code, comments, docstrings, task
  files, docs, commit messages. Conversation with the owner may be in Chinese.
- Two repositories are **archived, not maintained**: `ale-robotics-benchmark-private` (the
  maintainers' repository this one grew out of; the pre-ALE task form and its harness sit at
  its tag `legacy-harness-final`) and `ale-robotics-benchmark` (the public mirror, tag
  `legacy-v0.5-final`). Do not revive them, do not cite their paths (`ale-domain/`,
  `contrib-staging/`), and do not re-introduce their vocabulary (promote, publish, mirror).

## Workflow rules (every session)

1. **Start by reading `PROGRESS.md`** (repo root): current state, last stopping point, known
   gotchas. Restate them before touching anything.
2. **Before every hand-off, update `PROGRESS.md`** (state / next step / gotchas) and commit.
3. **Disk is the truth**: git + `PROGRESS.md` + this file. Session context is a volatile cache.
4. One milestone per named session; `/clear` between milestones.
5. Large changes start in plan mode; a human approves before execution.

## The task form (there is exactly one)

```
tasks/<platform>/<slug>/
├── task.yaml         strict core/v1: spec_type, stable `name` slug, image, resources,
│                     timeouts, artifacts, metadata{platform}
├── instruction.md    the prompt — the only thing the tested agent is told
├── image/Dockerfile  sole build context; final stage FROM ghcr.io/agentslastexam/container-ubuntu22-base;
│                     py3.12 /opt/venv (installs image/requirements.txt, the ONE Python dep list)
│                     + agent-UID import self-check
├── setup/run.sh      trusted root, before the agent: stages setup/payload/ (practice grader,
│                     dev copies) into the agent home
├── oracle/run.sh     the reference implementation; `ale validate` runs it in place of the agent
└── verify/           run.sh -> verify.py (the grader), env.py, anchor.json, grader_config.json,
                      robotics_grader/ (vendored kit) — ABSENT while the agent works
```

- Identity = `task.yaml`'s `name` slug. `metadata.platform` is the only metadata field: one of
  the fixed keys in `tasks/platforms.json` (this repository owns the vocabulary; the registry
  export hands it to the website, which only displays it). A landed task sits at exactly
  `tasks/<metadata.platform>/<name>/` (`scripts/lint_domain.py` battery 7 checks the key and
  the placement; a contribution's pull request puts the folder there directly). The metric and its
  direction live only in `verify/anchor.json` (`metric`, `direction`). There is no
  task-kind field and no evaluation-mode field: the three verify patterns (open_loop /
  closed_loop / artifact_rollout) are **authoring choices inside `verify/verify.py`**, not
  manifest fields. Do not reintroduce retired metadata keys from the archived form.
- The artifact contract (owner, 2026-09-05): the agent leaves ANY artifact in
  `/home/user/submission/` — a controller process, a plan or planner, a URDF / mesh /
  parameter design, generated code, a report; `verify/` scores it however the author
  decides; `oracle/` is simply the reference artifact (a hand-made file is fine). Wording
  everywhere says "submission" / "artifact", never "policy", where the artifact is meant
  ("code-as-policy" as a task-kind example is fine). Shapes + skeletons:
  `templates/README.md` "What a task can be".
- Hidden material is hidden by **stage isolation**: `verify/` and `oracle/` reach the sandbox
  only when their stage runs, `/opt/ale` is `drwx------ root:root`, and the solver runs at the
  agent's UID (`robotics_grader.Solver` / `deprivileged` via `runuser`). Proof:
  `docs/evidence/isolation-audit.md`. The repository being public changes nothing here: the
  anchor is hidden from the tested agent while it works, not from people.
- The engine reserves `config.json` inside `verify/` — grader knobs live in
  `verify/grader_config.json` and are read with `stage_config()`.
- `params:` are strict both ways: a declared parameter unused by `instruction.md` is a lint
  error.

## Gates

- **Engine gates** (from `vendor/ale`, clear `VIRTUAL_ENV`, pin the docker socket):
  `ale lint ../../tasks` and `ale lint ../../templates` (never the repository root: the
  engine would walk into `vendor/ale`), then `ale validate <task_dir>`. Validate runs the
  task twice: an **untouched** sandbox must produce an exact all-zero verdict, then the
  **oracle** runs in place of the agent and must score **exactly 1.0 on every reward key**.
  Both are the engine's own gates since 90a7c1c: `untouched_nonzero` / `oracle_not_full`,
  exit 2. Never describe the oracle rule as a warning or as "domain policy"; that framing is
  obsolete.
- `ale-onboard` classifies from the run records, not the exit status: a null-anchor run
  also fails with `oracle_not_full` and must read as `needs_anchor` (measured value
  reported), never as an error. Outcomes: `built` | `needs_anchor` | `needs_input` |
  `gave_up` (cannot be scored fairly) | `error`.
- `scripts/lint_domain.py`: hardware-invariant metric (`verify/anchor.json` names it, with a
  `direction` of higher or lower), positive metric scale, `full_at` present, visible-surface
  isolation (`setup/payload/` never reads the anchor or grader; the practice grader prints the
  raw metric only), image hygiene, anchor provenance (never a published figure), core/v1
  completeness, a `metadata.platform` from `tasks/platforms.json` and placement at
  `tasks/<platform>/<slug>/`.
- The template and the worked example (`tasks/space/fault_adaptive_spacecraft_docking`)
  each validate in well under a minute.

## Scoring (the kit owns it; do not re-derive)

```
ratio  = clamp(measured / anchor, 0, cap=1.5)   # inverted for direction: lower
reward = clamp(ratio / full_at, 0, 1)           # the single gated reward key
```

- `verify/anchor.json`: `metric` + `direction` (higher | lower) = the task's metric, declared
  nowhere else; `value` = the reference implementation's own measured value from a
  real run (never a printed figure; null while bootstrapping — that is `needs_anchor`, not an
  error); `full_at` = the ratio at which reward saturates, sized from measured seed spread.
- Metric must be an **outcome on a positive scale**; never wall-clock time / throughput / FPS
  / frequency. A negative reward becomes a positive cost with the anchor's `direction` lower; the kit
  refuses a non-positive anchor.
- `rewards` carries only `reward` (the task's score, 0 to 1); the raw metric, capped `ratio`,
  `match_lock_ok`, `anchor_recorded`, probe counts ride in the verdict's `metrics`.

## Kit vendoring rule

`shared/robotics_grader/` is the **canonical** verify-stage kit (stdlib-only). Every task
carries a **byte-identical vendored copy** at `verify/robotics_grader/`; CI diffs each copy
against the canonical one and fails the pull request on a difference. Nothing re-vendors a
task after it lands, so the copy a maintainer validated is the copy that scores. Edit
`shared/` and copy — never edit a vendored copy in place. Self-test:
`cd shared && python3 -m robotics_grader.selftest`.

## Contributing: one pull request

- The project's contribution guidelines (sign-up in the coordination sheet, the three roles,
  task stages, credit) are two Google Docs with the same content, linked from
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`:
  [English](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s1E3ymIBLujWf2l7rhu4g9Nl4orBfooK0aDWOdum7-Y/view)
  and [中文](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gX8v-w-idIPLjzoWgRskT0llE7cKXqg9sVLB0cWfZk0/view).
  Link them as `/view` URLs, never `/edit`. This repository documents what happens here.
- The sheet's Task Name, the folder name and `task.yaml`'s `name` are one string (preferably
  `snake_case`). Contributors get write access from the project initiator after signing up,
  push a branch (here or on a fork) adding
  `tasks/<platform>/<name>/`, and open the pull request; CI
  (`.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`: no secrets, so fork pull requests run it) is the same
  for everyone. No staging area, no promote step, no public mirror: the repository is public.
- Before the pull request a contributor runs `ale lint` + `ale validate` and measures
  difficulty with frontier models (`ale run`); the target is a frontier-model `reward` roughly
  below 0.5, reached by raising the engineering or perception challenge, never by arbitrary
  penalties. Check runs for the two pinned-harness defects first (300 s stream cut-off; the
  agent's `PATH` without `/opt/venv/bin`; `docs/contributing-a-task.md` §7).
- Maintainer flow: read `verify/` and `oracle/`, check out the branch, re-run `ale lint` +
  `ale validate` from `vendor/ale`, fix the anchor on the branch if the measurement
  disagrees, merge, then export the registry (`scripts/export_registry.py`) and commit
  `identity-history.json`.

## The registry export, and the website

- `scripts/export_registry.py`: `ale-robotics-task-registry/v2` from the engine's own loader
  (`spec_hash`, `content_digest`), metric/direction/anchor/full_at/cap from `verify/`,
  `platforms` from `tasks/platforms.json`; merges `identity-history.json`; **refuses a dirty
  tree**. Runs inside the engine venv (re-execs itself if needed). Its contract is
  `schemas/task-registry.schema.json`, owned here and tested against the export: change both
  in one commit. The protocol name (`ale-robotics-task-registry/v2`) and the `ALE_*`
  environment variables are runtime identifiers, not brand text: they did not change with the
  rename and must not be edited casually.
- The website (<https://agentic-robotics-benchmark.org>) is a display-only front end (owner
  decision 2026-10-15): it installs the registry export and shows the tasks, and its
  submission page links the two guideline documents. It takes no uploads, no run or score
  submissions, and has no leaderboard. Nothing in this repository depends on the website or
  reads from it; never reintroduce such a dependency.

## Commands

```bash

uv run pytest -q
```

## Discipline

- **Task data vs framework code**: `tasks/` and `templates/` are data; `harness/`, `scripts/`,
  `shared/`, `skills/` are code. Author the inputs; never hand-edit run outputs to make a gate
  pass.
- Onboarding goes through `skills/onboard-task/SKILL.md` (router → `onboard-open-loop` /
  `onboard-closed-loop` / `onboard-artifact-rollout`); `tests/test_skills.py` asserts the
  skills carry no retired vocabulary.
- Anti-cheat is **architectural isolation, not detection**: the grader is unreachable by the
  agent, seeds live only in grader memory, nothing the agent prints is a scoring input. The
  probe lock (closed_loop: the same step `t` is queried twice, true and perturbed observation
  in random order with no marker on the wire, only the true reply is applied) and
  re-simulation (open_loop) sit on top of that; they do not replace it.
- No secrets in the repo (`.env`, tokens, keys). No hardware-dependent scored metric. No
  100 MB+ blobs in git.
- `tasks/space/fault_adaptive_spacecraft_docking` (contributed in #1, merged 2026-10-15 after
  a maintainer pass) is the worked example of a complete task. Its difficulty is being
  re-measured: on its previous version, Opus 5.5 and Fable 5.1 scored 1.0. The dummy
  `uav_hover` (formerly `drone_hover`) was removed on 2026-10-15: a task frontier models solve
  trivially is neither a real example nor a task anyone could submit (owner decision).

## Gotchas (details in PROGRESS.md)

- `uv venv --python 3.12` puts its managed interpreter under `/root/.local/share/uv`, which
  the agent account cannot traverse → the venv silently fails for the solver UID with a
  misleading `ModuleNotFoundError`. Set `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/uv-python` and keep the
  Dockerfile's agent-UID import self-check. **Rule: the agent UID must traverse (not only
  read) everything the venv points at.**
- The engine stages `ale_verify` into whatever answers `python3` and refuses < 3.12.
- `ale validate` does not keep a stage's stderr — write what the grader says into a
  collected artifact.
- A null anchor is not an error; it is `needs_anchor` with the measured value. The engine
  prints `FAIL <task>: untouched={...}, oracle={'reward': 0.0}` (exit 2) and names the
  code, `oracle_not_full`, in the run's `validation.json`; read the records.
- When auditing isolation, mount permissions must match a real run, otherwise you measure
  your own audit tool.
- Two docker contexts on the dev machine → always `DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock`.
- Judge a background command by its log tail and container state, not the notification's
  exit code. Kill long runs by `pgrep`-selected pid, never a broad `pkill -f`.
- `export_registry.py` refuses a dirty tree on purpose: `content_digest` covers every regular
  file, including ignored `__pycache__/`. `--allow-dirty` is for throwaway exports only: it
  stamps `provenance.source_commit` `<sha>-dirty` + `dirty: true` and never writes the
  canonical `identity-history.json`.
