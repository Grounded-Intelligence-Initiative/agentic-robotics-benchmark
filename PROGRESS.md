> volatile cache. Read this file first; update it (state / next step / gotchas) and commit
> before every hand-off. Where it disagrees with the code or `git log`, the code wins: fix

## 0. 2026-09-07 — created by the rebrand from "ALE Robotics"

Origin: the maintainers' repository `ale-robotics-benchmark-private` at `86c2285` (its
history, including the Chinese progress log, stays there, archived) and the public mirror
`ale-robotics-benchmark` (archived, tag `legacy-v0.5-final`). This repository starts with a
fresh history and replaces both: it is public and carries every task folder whole, `oracle/`
and `verify/` included.

- **Layout flattened.** `ale-domain/tasks/` → `tasks/`, `ale-domain/templates/` →
  `templates/`, `ale-domain/identity-history.json` → `identity-history.json`,
  `ale-domain/_evidence/` → `docs/evidence/`, `ale-domain/README.md` → `tasks/README.md`.
  Verified with the engine loader: `drone_hover`'s `spec_hash` and `content_digest` are
  unchanged (a folder's location is not part of its identity), so `identity-history.json`
  still describes the tree.
- **Staging retired.** Both contribution channels (a pull request opened by hand; the
  website upload whose bot opens the same pull request) land a task directly at
  `tasks/<direction>/<slug>/`. Deleted: `contrib-staging/`, `scripts/promote_contribution.py`,
  `.github/workflows/promote-on-merge.yml`, `scripts/publish_public.py` and its tests.
  `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml` now runs the full check set on the final path, needs no
  secret (fork pull requests run it), and its registry identity cross-check treats a slug the
  history does not know as a notice, not a failure. `scripts/lint_domain.py` gained battery 7
  (placement: `tasks/<metadata.direction>/<name>/`); `harness/ale_onboard.py` and the lint
  walk only `tasks/` and `templates/`, never the repository root (that would descend into
  `vendor/ale`). `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` is new.
- **Renamed.** `pyproject` name `agentic-robotics-benchmark`; the download is
  `agentic-robotics-task-template.zip` with folder `agentic-robotics-task-template/`;
  `export_registry.py` release name "Agentic Robotics Benchmark" (`provenance.tasks_repo`
  follows the directory name); `GETTING-STARTED.md` rewritten for the two channels and the
  new domain `agentic-robotics-benchmark.org`; README, README.zh-CN, CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md
  (new), docs and skills rewritten for the brand and the flat paths. Added `LICENSE`
  (Apache-2.0, from the old public mirror) and `NOTICE`.
- **Unchanged on purpose** (runtime identifiers stay until a separate decision): `ALE_*`
  environment variables, the protocol names `ale-engine-run/v1` and
  `ale-robotics-task-registry/v2`, the console scripts `ale-onboard` / `ale-export`,
  `harness/export_run.py`'s exporter and benchmark names (they travel in bundle manifests
  the server reads), the engine pin `vendor/ale` @ `90a7c1c`, and every file of
  `tasks/control/drone_hover` (its `task.yaml` and `verify/verify.py` still carry three
  comments saying "ALE Robotics domain policy"; editing them would change the task's
  `content_digest`, so they go when the task goes: owner decision, delete `drone_hover` when
  the first community task is merged).
- **Not carried over** (owner decision; they live in the archived private repository):
  the Chinese `PROGRESS.md` history, `docs/prompts/` (session hand-off briefs),
  `docs/dev/archive/` (the pre-ALE snapshot and audits), `docs/tree_diagram/` (the taxonomy
  visualisation source; the workspace repository keeps the taxonomy markdown).
- **Verified at creation:** `uv run pytest -q` 225 passed, 1 skipped (the website registry
  cross-check, which runs when the website checkout is next to this repository); `ale lint ../../tasks` and
  `ale lint ../../templates` ok from `vendor/ale`; `scripts/lint_domain.py .` ok;
  `robotics_grader` selftest passed; the template's vendored kit byte-identical to
  `shared/`; the workflow file parses; a clean registry export reproduces
  `identity-history.json` byte for byte and the template zip builds (22 entries); ruff reports
  the same nine pre-existing style notes as before (non-blocking in CI).

## 1. 2026-09-08 — pushed; the pending contribution re-opened here

- `main` pushed to `https://github.com/Grounded-Intelligence-Initiative/agentic-robotics-benchmark`
  after the owner signed off the privacy checklist; the first `pr-checks` run on `main` is
  green (engine lint over `tasks/` + `templates/`, identity cross-check, static checks).
- The contribution `fault_adaptive_spacecraft_docking` (old repository PR #14, uploaded on
  the website by Jiankai-Sun, revision 2) is re-opened here as https://github.com/Grounded-Intelligence-Initiative/agentic-robotics-benchmark/pull/1 on branch
  `contrib/fault_adaptive_spacecraft_docking`: commit 1 = the 20 uploaded files byte for
  byte at `tasks/control/fault_adaptive_spacecraft_docking/`; commit 2 = `verify/robotics_grader/`
  re-vendored from `shared/` (the upload carried the 2026-09-05 kit). Old PR #14 closed with
  a pointer. Still to do by a maintainer before merge: `ale validate` (the anchor was a
  dry-run measurement; the oracle runs three hours).

## Open items

- Merge or reject the re-opened contribution after `ale validate`; on merge, export the
  registry, install it in the website, commit `identity-history.json`, and delete
  `drone_hover` (owner decision: with the first community task).
- Website: land uploads at `tasks/<direction>/<slug>/` here, show the pull request link to
  the uploader, rebuild the template download from this repository, switch the domain.
- Delete `drone_hover` when the first community task is merged (the registry must not be
  empty; the website's tests reference the slug).

## Gotchas

- `export_registry.py` refuses a dirty tree on purpose: `content_digest` covers every
  regular file, ignored `__pycache__/` included. Export from a clean commit; `--allow-dirty`
  is for throwaway exports and never writes the canonical `identity-history.json`.
- Never run `ale validate` on `drone_hover` casually: its oracle trains PPO for hours. The
  template validates in seconds.
- Engine commands run from `vendor/ale` with `VIRTUAL_ENV=` cleared and
  `DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock` pinned (two docker contexts on the dev machine).
  `uvx ruff`, not `uv run ruff` (ruff is not a project dependency).
- `uv venv --python 3.12` puts its managed interpreter under `/root/.local/share/uv`, which
  the agent account cannot traverse; task images set `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/uv-python`
  and keep the Dockerfile's agent-UID import self-check. The agent UID must traverse (not
  only read) everything the venv points at.
- The engine stages `ale_verify` into whatever answers `python3` and refuses < 3.12.
- `ale validate` does not keep a stage's stderr; it is in the episode's
  `trace.execution.jsonl`.
- A null anchor is not an error: the engine fails the run with `oracle_not_full` and
  `harness/ale_onboard.py` reads that as `needs_anchor` with the measured value.
- The template's `GETTING-STARTED.md` is an inline constant in
  `scripts/build_template_zip.py` (capped at 90 lines by its test); edit it there and rebuild
  the website's `apps/web/public/task-template/` copy plus `SOURCE.json`.
