"""ale-onboard — build an ALE-shaped robotics task and gate it on the real engine.

The orchestrator behind the onboarding skills, rebuilt on upstream ALE. It is deliberately
a thin, importable core (`onboard(...)` returns a structured `OnboardResult`) so the website
runner and a contributor's CLI drive exactly the same code.

What it does:

1. checks feasibility from the spec alone, and gives up honestly if the task cannot be
   scored fairly (a hardware-dependent metric, an unknown metric direction);
2. instantiates `templates/task/` into `tasks/<direction>/<task>/`, filling in
   what the spec knows and leaving TODOs where a human or an agent must still write physics;
3. runs the REAL gates — `ale lint` on the task collections, then `ale validate` on the task (its
   untouched-zero / oracle-one double pass), both from the pinned engine in `vendor/ale`;
4. reports one of four honest outcomes.

What it never does: invent a score, invent an anchor, or call something `built` that a real
`ale validate` did not produce. `built` requires the engine's double pass to hold: an
untouched sandbox scored exactly 0 on every reward key and the oracle exactly 1 on every
reward key. The engine enforces both (`untouched_nonzero`, `oracle_not_full`; exit 2).
This tool still classifies from the run records, not from the exit status, because the
bootstrap case fails the engine's gate on purpose:

A task whose anchor is still null runs, measures, and scores 0 by design, so the engine
reports `oracle_not_full`. Here that comes back as `needs_anchor` carrying the measured
value, which is the one number the author needs and cannot get any other way.
