# Task cards

A task's card says how displays (the website's task list, a task's page, the leaderboard) name
and file the task. The cards live in [`tasks/cards.toml`](../tasks/cards.toml), one table per
task named by its slug. Maintainers keep the file and add a task's card before its pull request
merges; a contributor may suggest a title in the pull request.

The file sits outside every task folder, so a card is no part of a task's identity: writing or
changing one changes no `spec_hash` and no `content_digest`, and needs no identity-history
record. (A field in `task.toml` would change both hashes, and with them the version every
agent's result is tied to.)

```toml
[hazard_bay_build]
title = "Rebuild a hazard bay, design and run its fleet"
summary = "Rebuild a plant's hazard bay in Isaac Sim from photos, design a fleet of flying and ground robots from a catalog, and program it through the job."
platforms = ["swarm", "uav", "ground", "arm"]
stages = ["hardware-design", "environment", "behavior"]
```

## Fields

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `title` | Required. A readable name in sentence case, at most 48 characters, no closing period, unique across the cards. It leads with what the agent does and names the robot: "Assemble a desktop arm with a Panda", "Fly a gate course by camera alone". |
| `summary` | One sentence, at most 200 characters, a capital letter first and a period last. Displays fall back to the brief's first paragraph without it. |
| `platforms` | Required. The keys of [`tasks/platforms.json`](../tasks/platforms.json) of every platform the task involves. The first is the folder's (`[metadata].platform`); the others are cross-references, for a task that also involves another kind of robot. |
| `stages` | Required. The stages of the workflow the task covers, in workflow order: `requirements`, `hardware-design`, `assembly`, `robot-description`, `control`, `environment`, `behavior`. A task that covers several lists them all (a multi-stage task). `end-to-end`, a task that runs the whole chain, is a category of its own and stands alone. |

## Conventions

- **Families share a pattern.** `*_requirements_replica_*`: "Specify upgraded replicas of a
  …"; `*_cad_design_*`: "Model a … in CAD"; `*_full_assembly_*`: "Assemble a … with …".
- **Control or behavior.** A task is `control` when its core is a feedback control law for the
  robot's own dynamics (docking a spacecraft, holding a quadrotor on a gate course). It is
  `behavior` when its core is deciding what to do and how to move to get a job done, even when
  what it emits are low-level commands (a supervisor that takes over a car, retargeting human
  hand motion to robot hands).
- **Which platform.** The most specific one wins. A legged robot is `quadruped` or `humanoid`;
  a car-like vehicle whose task is the driving itself, on a road or a track and at any scale,
  is `driving`; any other wheeled or tracked ground robot (an AMR or AGV, a UGV, a rover, a
  wheeled mobile manipulator) is `ground`. A task that also uses another kind of robot lists it
  after the folder's platform.

## Checks

`uv run python scripts/task_cards.py check` runs in CI (`pr-checks`, static-checks): every card
is well formed, names a task on the tree, starts with its folder's platform and lists its
stages in order, and no two cards share a title. A task without a card is a warning there;
`check --strict` makes it an error, the gate before a merge. `task_cards.py todo` lists the
tasks without a card and the cards without a task; `task_cards.py context <task>` prints what
naming a task needs (its `task.toml` facts, its brief's title, headings, first paragraph and
deliverables, and the cards of its family). [`schemas/task-cards.schema.json`](../schemas/task-cards.schema.json)
describes the parsed file.
