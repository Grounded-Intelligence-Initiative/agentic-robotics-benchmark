"""episode_score - how one supervised driving episode is scored. Grading stage only.

The score starts from route completion and is multiplied down for every infraction the
simulator recorded (`truth` from drive_bridge's Tracker):

    route completion
      x 0.5 per collision with a vehicle      (each counted, up to 3)
      x 0.6 per collision with anything else  (props, buildings, poles; up to 3)
      x 0.7 per red light entered             (up to 3)
      x max(0.8, 1 - 0.02 per harsh braking event: deceleration above 7 m/s^2)
      x pace factor

and is 0 after any collision with a pedestrian or with the scenario's own staged actors,
or for an aborted episode.

Pace: `truth["pace"]` is the distance the car made good along its route divided by the
distance it would have covered at the reference pace (0.85 x the road's speed limit,
limits above 50 km/h counted as 50 km/h, the nominal planner's own cap) over the time it
was not excused. Time stopped at a red or yellow light and time held by a blockage the
scenario requires waiting for are excused. A pace of 0.8 or better keeps the full score;
below that the factor falls linearly to 0.5 at a standstill.
