"""drive_protocol - the wire and the episode loop of a supervised driving episode.

Shared byte-identically by the grading stage and the practice grader: the scenario kinds,
the observation the supervisor gets, the reply it sends and the episode loop. The simulator
lives behind `sim_client.SimClient`; this module never imports it. How an episode is scored
is not part of it.

An episode: an ego vehicle drives a route in a CARLA town under a nominal planner (CARLA's
stock BehaviorAgent, 'normal' profile). Somewhere along the route a scenario is staged.
Every control period (0.1 s) the supervisor receives the front camera image, the ego speed,
the next navigation target and command, and the nominal planner's control, and either lets
the nominal control through or replaces it. The episode ends when the route is completed,
on a collision with a pedestrian, when the vehicle has been stationary for too long, when it
leaves the route, or at the time limit.

stdlib only, 3.8-compatible syntax.
