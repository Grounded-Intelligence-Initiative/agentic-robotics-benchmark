"""The customer's room: fixed geometry in metres (the survey the cell manual publishes exactly).

Room frame: origin at the south-west floor corner, x east, y north, z up. The bookcase is built on the customer's base
cabinet (a low cabinet standing free in the room, as wide and as deep as the bookcase); the drawings' floor plan shows
the cabinet and the bookcase's place on it. The flat-pack arrives unpacked: the tall panels stand on a panel cart, the horizontal panels lie
on two battens on a long kitting table.
