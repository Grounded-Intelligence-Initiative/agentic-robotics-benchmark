# Oracle: the privileged reference assembler, run in place of the agent by `ale validate` as the same unprivileged
# account. It installs assemble.py (camera frames, then one privileged call) and the 256-bit oracle token as
# .oracle_token; the grader compares the token's sha256 with verify/hidden/oracle_token.sha256 and, on a match, gives
# this submission's cells the nominal layout and the privileged call `reference_assemble` (the reference assembler
# inside the cell: true part poses, the two robots driven through the cell's own controllers, safety watch and joints).
