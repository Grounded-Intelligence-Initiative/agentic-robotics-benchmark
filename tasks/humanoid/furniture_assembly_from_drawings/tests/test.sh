#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Verify stage: runs as root, cwd = this staged folder, after the agent phase, in a SEPARATE verifier sandbox (task.toml
# [verifier] environment_mode = "separate"): a fresh sandbox from the task image that the agent never touched, holding
# only the declared artifact (/home/user/submission, restored root-owned). environment/setup/setup.sh never runs here:
# there is no ~/given, no practice lab and no process the agent started. The engine uploads this folder world-readable,
# so the FIRST thing done here -- before the interpreter starts -- is to close the folder and its parent to every other
# account (one chmod each; verify.py records the original modes from the two variables and restores them at the end,
# then kills the agent account's processes, snapshots the submission, gates late writes and locks every file; in the
# separate verifier the agent account's processes are the image's own desktop session, started with the sandbox).
#
# The grader's root-owned, read-only copy of the givens (/opt/arb) is built next: verify.py checks it file by file
# against given_hashes.json, runs the programs with its client library (/opt/arb/given/lib) and hands it to them as
# ARB_GIVEN_DIR, so nothing the agent wrote is an input of the grader. It holds what setup.sh stages into the agent
# home: setup_payload/, this folder's byte copy of environment/setup/payload/ (which never reaches the verifier;
# scripts/lint_domain.py checks that the two stay identical: change both, then given_hashes.json), and the image's
# robot model (/opt/arb-assets/unitree_g1 -> given/robot/unitree_g1), owned by root, group/world read-only.
#
# The grader runs as root with nothing of the agent home on its import or configuration paths: HOME and the XDG /
# matplotlib folders point at root's own, PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 and `-s` keep any user site-packages out, and the cell's
# cameras render their depth through OSMesa and their colour with MuJoCo's Filament renderer on lavapipe (the same
# paths as in the practice lab).
