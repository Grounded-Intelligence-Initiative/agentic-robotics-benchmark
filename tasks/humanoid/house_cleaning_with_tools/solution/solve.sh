# Oracle: the privileged reference cleaner, run in place of the agent by `ale validate` as the same unprivileged
# account. It installs clean.py (camera frames, then one privileged call) and the 256-bit oracle token as
# .oracle_token; the grader compares the token's sha256 with tests/hidden/oracle_token.sha256 and, on a match, gives
# this submission's cells the nominal layout and the privileged call `reference_clean` (the reference cleaner inside
# the cell: true object poses and process states, the G1 driven through the cell's own controller, grip rule, safety
# watch and cleaning processes).
