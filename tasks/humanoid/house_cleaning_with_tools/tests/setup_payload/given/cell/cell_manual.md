# The cleaning cell: the customer's studio apartment, one Unitree G1 humanoid, the rules

This is the integrator's description of the robot cell your program drives. Everything stated here as exact is exact;
everything else (where the litter, the dishes and the books lie, the grease spill, the crumbs, which bin stands where,
the robot's start pose, sensor noise) must be measured in each episode. The cell never reports the pose or the state of
anything but the robot itself.

## 1. The apartment (exact survey)

Room frame: origin at the south-west floor corner, **x east, y north, z up**, metres, radians, quaternions `w x y z`.
Boxes are given as `[x0, y0, z0, x1, y1, z1]`.

| item | geometry |
|---|---|
| floor, walls | floor z = 0 (oak planks); inner wall faces at x = 0, x = 6.0, y = 0, y = 5.0; 2.6 m high, the ceiling at z = 2.6; door opening in the south wall for 4.80 <= x <= 5.70 (2.05 m high, onto a hallway); window in the east wall for 1.60 <= y <= 3.00, 0.90 <= z <= 2.10 |
| drawn only (no obstacles) | skirting, the window's frame and board and the plant on it, pictures on the walls, a wall clock, two ceiling light panels, the rug in front of the couch (4.215 <= x <= 5.485, 3.39 <= y <= 4.91: it supports nothing, what is put on it rests on the floor) |
| couch (the customer's, fixed) | against the east wall, seat towards the west, within 5.09 <= x <= 5.95, 3.36 <= y <= 4.94; colliders: seat [5.09, 3.49, 0.16, 5.75, 4.81, 0.48], back [5.75, 3.49, 0.16, 5.95, 4.81, 0.94], arms [5.09, 3.36, 0.16, 5.95, 3.49, 0.72] and [5.09, 4.81, 0.16, 5.95, 4.94, 0.72], four legs 0.035 m square, 0.16 m high, at (5.12, 3.39), (5.12, 4.91), (5.93, 3.39), (5.93, 4.91) |

| sink | an apron-front basin, open above: inside 0.12 <= x <= 0.50, 2.28 <= y <= 2.78, bottom z = 0.70; walls 12 mm; its front wall (the apron) [0.50, 2.268, 0.62, 0.515, 2.792, 0.90] |
| faucet | column radius 0.022 at (0.065, 2.66) from the top up to z = 1.06; a low spout arching east to its outlet at (0.30, 2.66, 1.00), from which the water falls straight down; a single lever on top, pivot (0.065, 2.66, 1.085), axis along -y (lifting its end turns it positive), lever 0.17 m long pointing east, radius 7.5 mm |
| soap pump | a squat bottle radius 0.040 on the top at (0.30, 2.99), 0.12 high; its pump head is a flat disc radius 0.040, top at z = 1.059 at rest, travelling 20 mm down against a spring |

| dish tray | a grey rubber tray on the top, 0.40 (x) by 0.32 (y), centre (0.27, 2.09), base 4 mm, rim 18 mm high |
| kitchen props (fixed obstacles) | a utensil crock [0.045, 3.215, 0.90, 0.155, 3.325, 1.05], a herb pot [0.05, 1.19, 0.90, 0.17, 1.31, 1.01], a cutting board leaning on the splashback near y = 1.60 (drawn only) |
| bins (fixed bodies) | two flip-lid bins, their backs to the west wall: bodies [0.05, yc - 0.16, 0, 0.33, yc + 0.16, 0.60] for yc = 0.36 (south slot) and yc = 0.80 (north slot), walls 10 mm, inside bottom at z = 0.04; one is the **blue recycling bin** (a white recycling badge on its front), the other the **grey general-waste bin**; which stands in which slot varies per episode |
| bin lids | a lid 12 mm thick covers each bin, hinged along its back edge (axis along -y through (0.06, yc, 0.602); opening turns it positive, up towards the wall); a tab (radius 8 mm, 0.12 m long, along y) along its front edge at x = 0.354 (closed) |
| tool rail | on the south wall, [0.82, 0, 0.97, 1.62, 0.025, 1.03]; two spring clips whose jaws' centres are at (1.00, 0.048, 1.00) (the broom's) and (1.42, 0.048, 1.00) (the dustpan's) |
| dining table (fixed) | top [2.25, 2.13, 0.72, 3.45, 2.77, 0.75] (centre (2.85, 2.45), 1.20 by 0.64), four legs 0.045 square inset 0.06, a steel apron 0.06 deep under the top inset 0.06 |
| dining chairs (fixed) | at the table's ends, seats 0.44 by 0.44 at z = 0.46 centred (2.10, 2.45) (facing east) and (3.60, 2.45) (facing west), backs 0.88 high on their far sides, legs 0.032 square |
| coffee table (fixed) | top [4.33, 3.75, 0.42, 4.83, 4.55, 0.45] on four legs 0.035 square inset 0.04, nothing else under the top |
| bookshelf (fixed) | against the north wall [1.05, 4.66, 0, 2.35, 5.0, 0.92]: sides and boards 18 mm; boards at z = 0.06, 0.36 and 0.64 (their tops 0.078, 0.378, 0.658), top at 0.92; a divider at x = 1.70 splits it into a west and an east bay; rows of books already stand in it; things stand on its top |
| the books' compartment | the top compartment of the west bay: on the board at z = 0.658, between the books already there (they end at x = 1.234, a bookend there) and the divider: 1.25 <= x <= 1.69 for a book's middle, 4.67 <= y <= 4.99, 0.244 m of clear height (up to the underside of the shelf's top at 0.902) |

`describe()` repeats these numbers (`room`).

## 2. The mess (what varies)

After the dinner: on the **dining table** two plates, two glasses, a drinks can, two crumpled paper napkins and two
books (lying on their back covers), a **grease spill** (a dark, glossy film, about 0.2-0.4 m across, between the place
settings; it may run under a plate or a book) and crumbs round the plates; on the **floor round the dining set**
(never under the table or a chair) crumbs in two or three patches and a few strays; on the **coffee table** a drinks
can, a plastic water bottle, a napkin and an apple core (in its west half). The sponge lies in its tray (damp, no
soap, clean); the broom and the dustpan hang in their clips; both bin lids are closed; the water is off. The robot
starts just inside the door (about (5.25, 0.75), facing north). Positions, facings, the spill's shape, the crumbs and
the bins' order are drawn per episode.

Sizes: cans radius 0.033, height 0.122 (30 g); water bottle radius 0.034, 0.205 high plus a cap (32 g); napkins lumps
of about 0.05 m (12 g); apple core about 0.08 by 0.045 (30 g); plates radius 0.130, 0.022 high (0.45 kg); glasses
radius 0.035 (0.033 at the foot), 0.115 high (0.22 kg); books 0.160 x 0.030 x 0.235 m (red, 0.45 kg) and 0.150 x 0.024
x 0.210 m (blue, 0.34 kg); sponge 0.110 x 0.072 x 0.034 (yellow foam on top, a green scouring pad 10 mm thick on the
bottom; 22 g); crumbs 7-14 mm.

## 3. The robot

One Unitree G1 humanoid (29 DoF with Dex3-1 hands). The model is MuJoCo Menagerie's `unitree_g1/g1_with_hands.xml`
(copy in `~/given/robot/unitree_g1/`, BSD-3-Clause) with the cell's modifications (those of the furniture-assembly cell
of this benchmark):

* **Locomotion controller.** The pelvis rides four base joints: `base_x`, `base_y` (room x / y), `base_yaw` and
  `base_z`, driven by force-limited servos (x / y 300 N, yaw 150 N m) that the robot's own locomotion controller
  commands; the legs are posed from the stand height and do not touch the floor (no balance falls are simulated). A
  robot obstructed by furniture stops; its controller does not wind up beyond 5 cm / 0.1 rad.
* **Legs in the camera images.** The cameras draw the legs stepping while the base travels or turns (drawn only: the
  physics keeps the posed legs; nothing above the hips changes in the images).
* **Stand height** (pelvis height above the floor) 0.48 - 0.80 m, nominal 0.793 m; lower means a squat (the knees go
  forward: about 0.21 m ahead of the pelvis at 0.70, 0.34 m at 0.48, at knee height).
* Every robot body is gravity-compensated; payloads are not.
* Joints: waist yaw / roll / pitch, 7 per arm (shoulder pitch, roll, yaw, elbow, wrist roll, pitch, yaw), 7 per hand;
  ranges as in the model (`describe()` lists them).
* **Collision:** body links are capsules (Menagerie's `g1_mjlab.xml` colliders); the robot collides with the furniture
  and the loose objects, never with itself or the floor. **The hands (the `wrist_yaw_link` and the finger links) carry
  no contact**: grasping is the cell's grip rule (section 4). **What a hand holds does not collide with the robot
  either** (it is part of the hand while held); it collides with everything else.
* **Grasp site** of each hand, `<side>_grasp`: in the `<side>_wrist_yaw_link` frame at (0.150, -0.046, 0) for the left
  hand and (0.150, +0.046, 0) for the right hand, with the link's axes: **x = approach** (along the fingers), **y = pinch
  axis**, z = x cross y.
* **Head camera** `head`: an RGB-D camera on `torso_link` at (0.0576, 0.0175, 0.4299), optical axis along the link's +x
  pitched down by 0.8308 rad; it moves with the waist.

## 4. Grip rule (hands)

Closing a hand (`"close"`) engages a grip on an object when, at that instant, the hand's grasp site lies at one of the
object's grasp features:

* **bars and cylinders** (cans, the bottle, glasses, the broom's and the dustpan's handles, a lid's tab, the faucet's
  lever): the grasp site within 15 mm of the surface (at most the radius + 15 mm from the axis), between the feature's
  ends (cans and glasses from 12 mm above their foot to 12 mm below their top, the bottle up to 0.16 m, the broom's
  handle from 0.18 m above its swivel to its top, the dustpan's handle from 4 cm above its foot to its top), the pinch
  axis within 35 deg of perpendicular to the axis;
* **slabs** (books; the sponge, which counts as a slab both across its thickness and across its width): the pinch axis
  within 35 deg of the slab's thickness (for the sponge: of its thickness or of its width), the grasp site within 15 mm
  of the slab and at most 45 mm inside one of its edges or faces (and at least 5 mm from the corners along it);
* **discs** (plates): the pinch axis within 35 deg of the plate's axis, the grasp site within 15 mm of its mid-plane and
  at most 45 mm inside its rim;
* **lumps** (napkins, the apple core, the soap pump's head): the grasp site within 12 mm of its bulk (napkins 30 mm,
  the apple core 30 mm, the pump's head 40 mm from its middle).

A loose object is then held rigidly at the relative pose of that instant until the hand opens or the grip slips; a
fixture's moving part (a lid's tab, the faucet's lever, the pump's head) is held at that point only (it turns about its
hinge in the hand). A closed hand that found nothing holds nothing (open and close again). Grip limits: an object held
by one hand slips when the hand's load exceeds **30 N** or its torque about the grasp site exceeds **5 N m** (**12 N m**
when the hand holds it by a bar or cylinder feature: a power grasp); held by
both hands, when its net load per hand exceeds 30 N; a fixture's part held at a point slips beyond **60 N**; an excess
must last 50 ms. The hand's tactile reading (`get_state()`: `tactile_N`) is its share of the held object's load (0 when
it holds nothing).

## 5. Control (each 10 ms tick)

* Base: `base_velocity` [vx, vy, wz] in the robot's heading frame (x forward, y left; limits 0.5, 0.3 m/s, 0.8 rad/s;
  accelerations 0.8, 0.8 m/s^2, 1.5 rad/s^2), held until replaced; or `base_goal` [x, y, yaw] in the room: a straight-line
  approach (proportional, gain 1.2 /s, within the same limits, no obstacle avoidance) that stops within 5 mm / 0.01 rad.
  `stand_height` moves at 0.15 m/s.
* Waist: joint targets [yaw, roll, pitch], at most 0.8 rad/s.
* Arms: joint targets (`q`, 7 values), or a grasp-site pose target (`pose` [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz]) or position target
  (`pos` [x, y, z]: the wrist's orientation left free) in the robot's **base frame** (origin on the floor under the
  pelvis, x along the heading, z up; the default) or in the **room frame**. A target is solved by the cell's
  damped-least-squares IK over the arm's 7 joints (base, waist and legs as they are): a target within 0.12 m / 0.6 rad of
  the arm's previous target keeps the arm's configuration, a farther one gets a seeded global solve. `path: "line"`
  (default) moves the grasp site on a straight line with a minimum-jerk timing (about 0.25 m/s and 1 rad/s on average,
  peak accelerations at most 1 m/s^2 and 4 rad/s^2); `path: "joint"` moves in joint space to the target's IK solution.
  Joint targets move at most 1.5 rad/s with 6 rad/s^2. An unreachable target leaves the arm where the IK gets closest
  (`get_state()`: `ik_residual` [position m, rotation rad]). A target in the base frame travels with the base.
* Hands: `"open"` or `"close"` (closing applies the grip rule once).

## 6. Sensors

* `get_state()`: the localised base pose [x, y, yaw] (independent noise of about 3 mm and 0.2 deg per reading), the
  stand height, whether the base is moving, all waist, arm and hand joint angles (exact encoders), per hand `closed`,
  `tactile_N`, the grasp site's pose in the robot's base frame (exact kinematics) and the IK residual of a pose target.
* Cameras (`get_camera`): `ceiling_kitchen`, `ceiling_dining` and `ceiling_living`, fixed RGB-D cameras 960 x 720
  (vertical field of view 72 deg) whose exact poses and intrinsics `describe()` gives; `head`, 640 x 480 (58 deg), whose
  pose in the room at capture time comes with each frame (composed from the localised base pose and the exact
  kinematics). Pinhole, no distortion: fx = fy = (H / 2) / tan(fovy / 2), principal point at the image centre. Depth is
  along the optical axis, registered to the colour pixels, 1 mm quantisation, noise sigma 1.5 mm + 2.5 mm/m^2 z^2, invalid
  (0) below 0.28 m (head) / 0.40 m (ceiling), beyond 6 m, on depth discontinuities and on 2 % of the pixels at random.
  Colour is rendered physically based (MuJoCo's Filament renderer): the morning sun through the east window, the two
  ceiling panels, a light under the wall cabinets, the light the room reflects; a per-episode white balance / brightness
  draw and pixel noise. The grease film, the crumbs, the water stream, the soap on the sponge and the sponge's colour
  (it darkens as it takes up grease) are drawn as they are. **At most 1500 frames per episode** over all cameras.

## 7. Fixtures and tools

* **Bin lids.** A lid turns 0 (closed) to 1.431 rad (82 deg, against its stop). Above 0.96 rad (55 deg) a hold-open
  spring (0.35 N m) holds it open; below, its weight closes it (a lid let go below 55 deg falls shut). Something falling
  onto a closed lid stays on it; through an open lid (above 35 deg) it falls in.
* **Faucet.** The lever turns 0 to 0.62 rad; the water runs while the lever is above 0.15 rad (full flow from 0.40);
  the lever stays where it is left (friction). The water falls straight down from the outlet to the basin's bottom.
* **Soap pump.** A stroke is the head pushed down at least 12 mm (of its 20 mm) and let back up above 4 mm; a stroke
  made while the **sponge presses on the head** puts one dose of soap into the sponge (at most 2 doses held); any
  other stroke wastes its dose.
* **Clips.** A tool whose handle is let go of with its axis within 12 mm of its clip's jaw centre, and the handle within
  12 deg of vertical (the jaw centre between 5 cm above the handle feature's lower end and 2 cm below its upper end),
  clicks in and hangs there; a hand that grips a clipped tool takes it out of the clip.
* **Broom.** A handle (aluminium, radius 11.5 mm, with a black grip at its top), its frame's origin on the head's swivel
  axis, the handle from 0.10 m to 1.20 m along its axis; the head (red block 0.30 x 0.055 x 0.035 with black bristles
  0.29 x 0.045 x 0.045 below it, their bottom 0.08 m below the swivel axis) swivels about its long axis within +-50 deg,
  so it stays flat on the floor while the handle leans along the stroke; 0.52 kg.
* **Lobby dustpan.** A grey pan 0.30 wide (x) and 0.24 deep (y, from the lip to the back wall), back wall 0.09 high,
  side walls lower towards the lip; a black rubber lip along its front edge; its frame's origin at the middle of the
  lip, on the floor when the pan rests flat; the handle (radius 12 mm, 0.80 long) rises from the back wall's top,
  leaning back by 8 deg, so the dustpan stands on its own on the floor; 0.45 kg.

## 8. The cleaning rules (never reported)

* **Grease.** The table's top carries a grease film on a grid of 20 mm cells (grease g in [0, 1] per cell; one unit of
  grease is what a 25 mm square at g = 1 holds, so a full 20 mm cell holds 0.64 units). The sponge pressed flat on the top
  (its faces within 25 deg of the top) with a normal force N above 2 N, sliding, takes grease off every cell under its
  face: per tick g -> g exp(-0.8 min(N - 2, 25) ds f), ds the distance it slid (m), f = (scouring pad down 1.0 | foam
  down 0.35) x (soap in the sponge 1.0 | wet, no soap 0.30 | dry 0.12) x (1 - load / 32). What comes off loads the
  sponge (in units; it holds 32); a loaded sponge puts grease back on the cells it passes (g rises by
  0.25 x (load / 32)^3 per sponge length slid): a saturated sponge smears. Soap is used up as grease comes off (1/38 dose
  per unit).
* **Rinsing.** The sponge held in the running water (its middle within 45 mm of the stream's axis, between the basin's
  bottom and the outlet) sheds its load (time constant 0.6 s) and its soap (2.5 s), and is wet.
* **Crumbs** rest on the highest surface below them; they are moved only as follows. The broom's bristles, flat on the
  floor (their bottom within 20 mm of it, the head within 35 deg of level) and moving, push the floor crumbs under them
  out over their leading edge (faster than 1.0 m/s they scatter instead, 0.1-0.4 m ahead); the sponge does the same to
  the crumbs on the surface it is pressed on, and a crumb pushed over an edge flies on 10-20 cm the way it was pushed and
  falls. A crumb stops at whatever stands on
  the floor (the walls, the toe kick, the bins, the legs of the tables, chairs and couch, the plant's pot, the
  bookshelf). The dustpan resting flat on the floor (its lip within 8 mm of it, the pan within 12 deg of level) takes in
  the floor crumbs pushed over its lip into the pan (a pan set down on crumbs only covers them); they stay in the pan as
  it moves unless it is tipped past 55 deg,
  when they pour out over its lowest edge (the lip; a side past 65 deg; over the back wall only upside down) and fall.
  A crumb that falls into an open bin stays there; onto a closed lid it stays on the lid.
* **Dishes.** A plate or a glass breaks when it hits something hard: its speed dropping by more than 1.2 m/s within a
  tick while it touches something, or a contact force above 60 N (a drop of more than about 7 cm). A broken dish earns
  nothing.

## 9. Safety (a violation makes the episode score 0; the episode goes on)

* a robot link other than the hands pressing on anything with more than 150 N for 0.2 s;
* a loose object let go of (or slipping) while moving faster than 1.5 m/s (thrown);
* a loose object not held, and not let go of in the last 2 s, moving faster than 4 m/s (struck).

## 10. Budgets per episode

4800 s of simulated time; 3600 s of program time (the episode's wall clock minus the cell's own time inside `step`,
simulating, and inside `get_camera`, rendering: your program's computation and all its other requests count); 120 s
from a reply to the next request (silence) ends the episode; 1500 camera frames; at most 500 ticks per `step` call.
