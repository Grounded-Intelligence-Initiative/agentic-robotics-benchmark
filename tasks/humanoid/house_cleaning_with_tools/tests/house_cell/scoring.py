"""The episode's cleaning score (grader only): the customer's checklist, read from the cell's state when the episode
ends. Credit out of TOTAL = 10:
  * trash sorted, 2.0: each of the seven pieces (the two cans and the water bottle in the recycling bin; the three
    napkins and the apple core in the general-waste bin) 2/7 when it lies inside the right bin (below the rim);
  * dishes cleared, 1.0: each plate and glass 0.25 when it stands on the dish tray beside the sink (on the tray or
    on a dish on it), unbroken;
  * books shelved, 1.0: each book 0.5 when it rests in the top compartment of the bookshelf's west bay, east of
    the books there (its middle inside the compartment, its lowest point on the shelf or on the other book), standing
    or lying;
  * table degreased, 2.5 x min(1, removed / 0.95): removed = 1 - the grease left on the table (smears included) over
    the grease at the start;
  * floor swept, 2.5 x min(1, binned / 0.9): binned = the share of all the crumbs (the table's and the floor's) that
    lie in the general-waste bin;
  * finishing, 1.0, for putting things back after using them: the sponge back in its tray, rinsed (its grease load
    below a tenth of what it can take) 0.3, once at least half of the grease is off; the broom and the dustpan each
    hanging in its clip 0.15, once at least half of the crumbs are in the general-waste bin; the faucet off 0.2, once
    the water has run; each bin lid closed 0.1, once the bin holds something that belongs in it.
A safety violation zeroes the episode (the grader applies it).
