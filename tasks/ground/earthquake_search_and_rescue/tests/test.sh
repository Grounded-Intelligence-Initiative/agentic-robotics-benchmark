# Verify stage: runs as root, cwd = this staged folder, after the agent phase, in a SEPARATE verifier sandbox (task.toml
# [verifier] environment_mode = "separate"): a fresh sandbox from the task image that the agent never touched, holding
# only the declared artifact (/home/user/submission, restored root-owned); environment/setup/setup.sh never runs here.
# The engine uploads this folder with modes 0644 / 0755, so the FIRST thing done here -- before the interpreter starts --
# is to close the folder and its parent to every other account (one chmod each; verify.py records the original modes
# from the two variables and restores them at the end, then kills the agent account's leftover processes, snapshots the
# submission, gates late writes and locks every file).
#
# The grader runs as root with nothing of the agent home on its import or configuration paths: HOME and the XDG /
# matplotlib folders point at root's own, PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 and `-s` keep any user site-packages out, and the cell
# renders through OSMesa (the training ground's cell uses the same path).
