# Oracle: the photographed robot as the FreeCAD document the task asks for (42 PartDesign Bodies labelled P01..P42, the 12
# actuator units and 4 foot pads imported from the given STEP files, one Assembly with its Grounded, Fixed and Revolute
# joints and limits, saved in configuration Z), written to $ALE_HOME/submission/quadruped.FCStd. `ale validate` stages
# this folder in the agent's home and runs this script as the agent account (cwd = the staged folder).
#
# The document is BUILT here rather than shipped: prebuilt it is about 41 MB (PartDesign stores every part's B-rep three
# times), above the task's 20 MB limit for a stored oracle. reference/ holds the inputs: assembly.json and parts/*.step
# (byte-identical to the grader's verify/reference/ files: the robot in its own form, one STEP file per part geometry),
# core.step and foot.step (byte-identical to the payload's actuator and foot pad STEP files) and oracle_build.py, run by
# the image's headless FreeCAD (12-20 s, most of it the save). Scores 1.0 on every gate and criterion.
