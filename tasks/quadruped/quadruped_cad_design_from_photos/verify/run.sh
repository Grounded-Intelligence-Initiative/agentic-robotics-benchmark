# account (verify.py records the original modes from the two variables, freezes and kills the agent account's
# leftover processes, snapshots the submission, gates late writes, locks every file and restores the modes at the end).
# The grader executes no agent code (the FreeCAD document is data read by headless FreeCAD).
