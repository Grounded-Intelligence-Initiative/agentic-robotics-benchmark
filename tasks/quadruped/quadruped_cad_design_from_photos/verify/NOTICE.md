# NOTICE - source of the ground truth of this task (verify / oracle only; never shown to the agent)

The photographed robot of this task (its ground truth in `reference/`, the oracle's inputs in `../oracle/`) is a
**modified derivative** of the open-hardware 12-DoF quadruped **Solo12** of the Open Dynamic Robot Initiative:

- printed parts, assembly and actuator design: https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/open_robot_actuator_hardware,
  commit `66af1522b4fba0ec4a1d7790e66f5e4652208d30` (`mechanics/quadruped_robot_12dof_v1/`, `mechanics/leg_3dof_v1/`,
  `mechanics/actuator_module_v1/`, and the core parts of `mechanics/biped_6dof_v1/cad_files/STEP/biped_6dof_v1.STEP`);
- kinematics and inertial data: https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/robot_properties_solo, commit
  `2201f454f4caffa0cad307fa8cbd1d64dd844008` (`src/robot_properties_solo/resources/xacro/`).

What was derived and how it was modified: the thirteen printed part designs were re-modelled as parametric B-rep solids
from the published STL meshes and placed with the published assembly; the bought actuator core and the foot pad were
re-modelled as stand-ins with fictional part numbers. The robot was then modified by this task's generator: changed leg
segment lengths and body length, lightening cut-outs, a new colour, and photographed with the benchmark's render layer
(Blender Cycles). The task never names the source, and the names of the copyright holders and contributors are not used to

Other material:
- the photo scenes use procedural, self-made assets (bench, cutting mat, checker targets, rulers, ID-1 card, paper tags)
  inside a lab room built from the project's licensed Unity asset pack (Archviz Laboratory Pack); the Cycles world light is
  the HDRI "Schadowplatz" by Greg Zaal (Poly Haven, CC0), as shipped in that pack. Only the rendered photos are distributed.
- the public-model digest list (`given/public_blocklist.json`) holds sha256 digests of the source repositories' mesh and
  CAD files and vertex fingerprints of the re-modelled nominal parts; it contains no geometry.
- FreeCAD 1.1.4 (LGPL-2.0-or-later, https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD) is installed unmodified in the task image from its
  release AppImage, with the FreeCAD MCP server neka-nat/freecad-mcp @ `78bf023` (MIT, https://github.com/neka-nat/freecad-mcp)
  vendored unmodified (`image/vendor/freecad-mcp/`).
