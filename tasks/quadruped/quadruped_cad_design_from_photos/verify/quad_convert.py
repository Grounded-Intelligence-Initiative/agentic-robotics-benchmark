"""quad_convert: infer the agent's mechanism from its FreeCAD document (fcstd_extract.py's record) and write it in the
ground truth's own form (quad-cad-gt/1, gt_quad/CONTRACTS.md section 8), so that one loader reads both. GRADER_SPEC
section 3; a task-local fork of the arm task's fcstd_convert.py (serial chain) for a tree.

    res = convert(extract_dir, reference_dir, given_dir, out_dir, config=None)
    res = {"ok", "errors", "warnings", "stats", "details", "conversion", "legs_valid"}

Runtime: heavy documents (shape files totalling >= conversion.pool_min_total_mb) are tessellated and written by
`spawn` worker processes (conversion.workers, CPU affinity bound; conversion.part_timeout_s for all parts together): the
calling script must guard its entry point with `if __name__ == "__main__"` (verify.py does). use_brep_siblings() is
installed globally (cad_drawings_check.load_step_solids reads the BREP beside a STEP first), so the grader reads the
tier's parts exactly.

ok = False is `cad_valid` = 0 with the reasons in `errors` (no extraction record, the document does not open, not
exactly one top-level Assembly, no Grounded joint, the grounded group does not stand for the body, a closed loop, a joint
of another type); anything else only invalidates the legs or items it touches and is reported in the conversion block
(GRADER_SPEC 4: missing parts, cores or feet only invalidate the legs or items they belong to). Nothing raises for a
missing or broken document (a broken REFERENCE folder raises quad_task.SpecError: a task error).

The steps (GRADER_SPEC 3.1-3.8):
  parts      leaves labelled with a tag of the reference, present once, one valid watertight solid each, at a finite
             placement (else missing); cores and foot pads by shape class (the extractor), unusable when their pose is
             not the given geometry's or their placement is not finite;
  groups     union-find over Fixed joints, rigid units (App::Part; a rigid sub-assembly without inner joints) and all
             Grounded components; a revolute joint whose own Placement1 / Placement2 is not finite is broken and not
             read (its leg is invalid); one whose frame on one reference is not finite (that component's placement is
             not) is read from its other reference;
  tree       revolute joints are edges between groups; a breadth-first walk from the grounded group (sorted, so
             deterministic); an edge back to a reached group is a loop; groups not reached are floating;
  links      the body = the grounded group, when it carries more of the body's tags than of any other single link's
             (else cad_valid = 0); a body tag it lacks (missing, floating or fixed into a leg link) costs only that
             part's own items, a leg tag it carries only keeps that leg's link from matching (conversion.body lists
             both); a leg link matches the reached group whose tag set equals the link's exactly and whose tree parent
             is the group matched to the link's parent;
  cores      each revolute joint of the tree is driven by a core rigidly in its parent group whose +z lies within 5 deg of
             the joint axis: among those within 2 mm of the axis line the one whose output centre is nearest to the
             child group's parts, else the nearest line (inconsistent); one core per joint, assigned greedily over all
             (joint, core) pairs in that order (the coaxial front / hind HAA cores cannot both go to one joint);
  sense      positive = the driving core's +z; the saved pose is zero; limits = AngleMin / AngleMax relative to the
             saved angle (the signed angle of the two joint frames' x axes about the first's z), negated for a
             child-first joint and again for a frame whose z opposes the core's +z, then clipped to [-pi, pi]; a
             declared range a full turn wide is the full turn [-pi, pi] whatever the saved angle;
  legs       a leg is valid when none of its parts is missing, its three links are matched, each joint has a driving
             core and is consistent (axis within 1 deg and 0.5 mm of the core's output axis; the child's parts rest on
             the parent's or on the core: gap <= 0.2 mm) and its lower link carries exactly one foot pad;
  alignment  6 DoF, agent world -> robot frame: a Kabsch seed on the valid legs' HAA cores (output centre and the point
             50 mm along +z, matched by leg; the best-supported pair of non-collinear legs, ties broken by the body
             parts' fit), else on the body parts' centroids; refined by the restricted point-to-plane ICP of the agent's
             body parts onto the reference's (15 mm / 15 deg from the seed, fixed sample seeds);
  writer     links world-aligned at q = 0 in the aligned frame, a link's origin = its driving core's output centre
             projected onto the joint axis (the body: the robot origin); every valid part as STEP + BREP in the aligned
             robot frame (file frame) with T_link = the translation into its link (parts of groups that match no
             written link: link null, T_link identity); cores and foot pads as occurrences; joints depth-first (leg by
             leg: MuJoCo's qpos order); foot points = the foot pads' origins in the lower-leg frames.
