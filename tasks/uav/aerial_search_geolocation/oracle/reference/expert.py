"""Privileged reference expert for aerial_search_geolocation.

Graded with the oracle token (see verify/verify.py), every observation carries
`privileged`: the objects placed in the scene, by description, in the mission start frame,
and `clearance`, how far each move could go from where the drone is before it touches
anything. Decoys (asked descriptions no placed object has) are declared absent from the
start; a present target is reported, at its true position, only once the drone has been to
it and looked, since a target only counts once the drone has been there:

* the nearest target not yet visited is next; the drone climbs to a transit height above it,
  turns toward it and flies until it is over a hover point 2 m from the target, a metre
  or more off any surface, climbing over whatever is in the way and flying out from under
  whatever shuts the way up;
* it descends there into the visit window (within 3 m horizontally, at most 6 m above the
  target, the target in the down camera's view), holds there for a step with the down
  camera on it, reports it, climbs back to the transit height and goes on; a hover point
  it cannot get down to is swapped for the next one round the target, and a target with
  none it can reach is reported anyway (an unvisited report scores nothing, but costs nothing);
* a move is made only when its clearance leaves a margin; once every present target is
  visited, it stops.

Without the privileged block (no or a wrong token) it reports nothing and stops.
