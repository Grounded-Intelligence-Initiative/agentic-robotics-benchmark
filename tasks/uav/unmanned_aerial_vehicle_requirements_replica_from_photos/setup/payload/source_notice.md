# Platform provenance
This fixture derives its guarded four-rotor core from AgiPix by Sasanka Kuruppu Arachchige and collaborators:
https://github.com/SasaKuruppuarachchi/agipix/tree/147a736b9fea7ac0e8d08c9a5fb0b90e5baa224a. The source repository's LICENSE is CC0-1.0; a copy is in `licenses/agipix-CC0.txt`.
The mesh source is `cad/model_exports/agipix/body.stl`; rotor placement comes from `agipixv2.usd`.
The upstream BOM and hardware-assembly guide establish the carbon-fibre / printed-adapter construction,
four motors, four-in-one ESC, 6S power and PX4/companion-computer architecture.

This is a procedurally rendered lab-built derivative. The obsolete battery and motor-shell volumes fused into
the source body export are removed before fitting the open cage and retired survey motors. Core geometry is scaled during fabrication; the installed
battery cage, ballast pod and scanner are benchmark fixtures. No upstream performance claim is an acceptance
value. Vesper Motion products, lot measurements, masses, procurement prices and customer clauses are synthetic.
The reduced-order mass and bench-power model in B-09 is the contractual acceptance model, not flight certification.
The images are Blender Cycles renders of the same fixture whose geometry is used for acceptance.
