"""Driving an agent-built solver across the privilege boundary (the closed_loop pattern).

The grader owns the simulator and asks the agent's policy for one action at a time. Three
properties make that safe to score:

1. **The solver runs as the agent, not as root.** `verify/run.sh` is root — the framework
   runs it on the task's behalf — so spawning the solver directly would give the agent's
   code the grader's own privileges. `stage.deprivileged` drops to the agent account, and
   from there `/opt/ale` is untraversable and the grader's memory unreadable.
2. **Every exchange has a deadline.** A solver that hangs must cost the episode, not the
   run. Reads happen on a queue fed by a reader thread, so a stall is a timeout rather
   than a wedged pipe.
3. **The wire carries no scoring input.** The solver returns actions. The metric is
   computed by the grader from its own simulator state, so nothing the solver prints can
   move its score.

The protocol is one JSON object per line, stdout only, `READY` first (within
`READY_TIMEOUT_FACTOR` step deadlines of launch):

    {"type": "reset"}                        -> {"ok": true}
    {"type": "act", "t": 0, "obs": <json>}   -> {"action": <json>}
    {"type": "close"}                        -> {"ok": true}, then exit

`t` is the step index inside the episode — an integer the GRADER owns, restarting at 0
after every `reset`. `obs` is the observation exactly as the task's environment produces
it (a flat list for most tasks; a task with structured observations documents the shape
in its instruction). The solver answers every request from the observation it carries.

**Nothing on the wire says whether a request is a probe.** The match lock (`ProbeLock`)
asks a probed step twice with the SAME `t` — once with the real observation, once with a
perturbed copy, in an order the solver cannot predict — and applies only the real reply
to the simulator. A repeated `t` is therefore an ordinary event the instruction tells the
agent about ("a step may be queried more than once; repeated queries do not advance the
episode; count steps by `t`, not by requests"), and nothing on the wire tells the solver
which of the two requests is the probe. The old design flagged probes with `"probe": true`,
which let a canned policy pass the lock by reacting only to flagged requests. The lock
catches a policy that ignores its input; it is not a proof of honesty, because a solver
that notices a repeated `t` can vary its answer on purpose. Isolation, not the lock, keeps
a score honest.

**An aborted episode does not take the rest of the run with it.** After a timeout, a
crash, a protocol error or a reply without an action, the wire may still hold a line meant
for an earlier request, so the next `reset` stops the solver (its whole process group) and
starts `run.sh` again, which must print `READY` again. At most `max_restarts` restarts
happen in a run (3 by default); after that, or after a restart that fails, every remaining
episode aborts at once instead of costing another deadline. The instruction must say so,
because a solver that keeps a PID file, a fixed port or a lock file has to survive being
started twice.
