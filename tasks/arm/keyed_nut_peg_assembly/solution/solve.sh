# Privileged reference solution: a scripted controller that reads the ground-truth scene state
# (nut pose and keyway angle, peg poses). The grader attaches that state to the observations only

# the agent never sees the token. The solution only shows that every hidden episode can be done
# with the public robot, controller and step budget. Runs as the agent account; spends no lab
# trials; reads nothing outside solution/.
