# close the folder and its parent to every other account (one chmod each; verify.py records the original modes from
# the two variables and restores them at the end, then kills the agent account's leftover processes, snapshots the
# submission, gates late writes and locks every file: CHAIN_PLAN 4.0 stage lock, hardened 2026-09-27; in a separate
# verifier the agent left no process and wrote nothing, and these stop the image's own desktop session of the agent
# account and set aside what it writes).
