# Skid cell API (`cell`), version pump-skid-cell/0.6.0

Your program `/home/user/submission/operate.py` exposes `solve(cell) -> None`. The grader runs it once per hidden
episode in a fresh process under a dedicated unprivileged account, from a per-run directory holding a root-owned
READ-ONLY copy of your submission folder (regular files only: symbolic links and `__pycache__` are not copied), with an
empty writable `$HOME` / `$TMPDIR`, a minimal environment (`PATH`, `HOME`, `TMPDIR`, `LANG`, `MUJOCO_GL=osmesa`,
`PYTHONPATH` = a read-only copy of `~/given/lib`, `ARB_GIVEN_DIR` = a read-only copy of `~/given`, BLAS threads 2) and
the launcher `python3 -B -E -s -c <bootstrap> <lib> operate` (the bootstrap puts `<lib>` on `sys.path` and calls
`skidcell.client.main`, which imports `operate` from the current directory), or `bash run.sh` when you ship one.
Every process of the program runs with no network: a seccomp filter refuses every socket but a Unix-domain one
(`socket()` of an inet family fails with `PermissionError`); the cell's wire is a pipe pair and needs none. Before the
first episode the grader imports `operate` once under the same regime to check that it defines `solve`: that import must
finish within 120 s of wall clock and 120 CPU seconds (all threads together: a library that runs many threads spends
CPU seconds faster than wall seconds); a failed or slower import scores every episode 0, so keep heavy precomputation
out of module level (inside `solve` it counts against the episode's program time). Each episode's CPU time is capped at
4x its program time.
`cell` is a proxy (`skidcell.client.Cell`): every method is one JSON-lines request on the process's original stdout,
answered on stdin by the grader's cell; `print()` goes to stderr. A reply carrying `error` raises
`skidcell.client.CellError`.

Units: metres, radians, seconds, quaternions `wxyz`; the world frame is the skid's frame (`cell_manual.md` section 1).
The robot's own state is exact on the wire; **nothing about the skid is**: no valve position, no gauge, lamp, level
or display reading, no device pose, not even which device the gripper holds. You see the skid through the cameras. The
one document on the wire is the site's equipment list (`describe()["site"]`).

| call | returns | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `describe()` | `cell_version`, `units`, `robot` (joints and ranges, home posture, tcp, gripper), `rail` (axis, ranges, speeds), `control` (tick, rate limits, stiffness range, modes, the Cartesian frame), `grip_rule`, `cameras` (size, exact intrinsics, the fixed cameras' poses, the wrist camera's mount), `skid` (front plane, extent), `site` {`name`, `equipment`: one entry per device {`series_tag`, `site_tag`, `service`, and for the valves `startup_position`}, `log_sheet`: the site tags to log}, `schedule` (startup deadline, shift end, sim cap, the bands), `budgets`, `safety` | static for the episode |
| `get_state()` | `sim_time`, `done`, `arm` {`q`[7], `dq`[7], `cmd_q`[7], `tcp_pos`[3], `tcp_quat`[4], `mode`, `stiffness_scale`, `gripper_width`, `holding`, `wrist_load` {`force_N`[3], `torque_Nm`[3]}, `protective_stop` {`active`, `remaining_s`, `count`, `locked_out`}}, `rail` {`x`, `lift`, `x_goal`, `lift_goal`}, `horn` | `holding`: the gripper holds a handle (the grip rule engaged); `wrist_load`: the external wrench on the hand estimated from the joint torques, world axes, force at the tcp and moment about the tcp, what the surroundings exert on the robot (contacts and a held handle alike; noise and a posture-dependent offset: `cell_manual.md` section 2); `protective_stop`: the robot's stop state and the shift's count (`cell_manual.md` section 4); `horn`: an alarm sounds (which one: the panel's lamps and the instruments) |
| `set_control(mode, stiffness_scale)` | ok | `mode` in `joint`, `cartesian`; `stiffness_scale` in [0.2, 1.0] scales the seven joints' position gains and damping |
| `command(q=[7])` or `command(tcp_pos=[3], tcp_quat=[4])`, optional `width` | ok / error | targets are held until the next command; joint targets are clamped to the ranges and rate-limited to 1.5 rad/s; Cartesian targets (world frame) go through the cell's damped-least-squares differential IK on the `panda/tcp` site (<= 0.5 m/s, 1.5 rad/s, the joint rate limit); `width` (m, 0..0.08) ramps at 0.05 m/s; closing on a handle engages the grip rule, opening wider releases it. In a protective stop a command with a target answers `{"ok": false, "error": "protective_stop", "remaining_s": ...}` (`locked_out` once the robot is out of service) and moves nothing; `width` alone still works |
| `command_rail(x=None, lift=None)` | ok, `x_goal`, `lift_goal` | the carriage's goal along the rail (x) and the lift's height (the Panda base's z); clamped to the ranges, ramped at 0.30 m/s and 0.15 m/s; refused in a protective stop, as `command` |
| `step(n_ticks)` | `sim_time`, `done`, `events[]` | advances n x 10 ms (5 x 2 ms physics steps each) of the cell AND the process; nothing moves and no time passes outside `step`; n <= 1000 per call; events: `grasped` / `released` / `slipped` (the grip rule; the hand feels the grip, it does not know the device), `protective_stop:<robot link>:<force>N` / `protective_stop_cleared` (the safety watch's stop and its end, 5 s later), `safety:damage:<robot link>:<force>N` / `safety:locked_out` (the robot is out of service for the rest of the shift), `horn_on` / `horn_off`, `window_open` (600 s), `shift_end` (1500 s), `physics_fault`, `episode_over` |
| `get_camera(name, depth=True)` | `camera`, `frame_index`, `sim_time`, `width`, `height`, `format` (`png`), `rgb_png_b64`, with depth `depth_u16_mm_b64`, `depth_unit_m` (0.001), `depth_invalid_value` (0); for `wrist` also `T_world_cam` (4x4, OpenCV convention) | one frame of `overview` or `wrist` at the current state; at most `budgets.camera_frames` frames per episode over all cameras, then `{"error": "camera_budget"}`; rendering takes about 0.2-1 s of wall clock per frame (not charged to your program time) |
| `log_reading(tag, value, unit)` | ok, `tag`, `sim_time`, `round`, `in_window` | one entry on the operator's log sheet (`sop.md` 2.3): `tag` the SITE tag of one of PI-101, PI-103, PDI-111, FI-105, LG-201, AI-201 (`describe()["site"]["log_sheet"]`); `unit` one of bar, psi, kPa, m3/h, L/min, %, mg/L; `round` (1, 2 or null) and `in_window` follow from the clock alone: the reply says neither whether the value is right nor whether the entry counts (only an entry made while P-101 runs does) |
| `finish()` | ok | ends the episode; the grader then scores the episode's record |

`skidcell.client.decode_frame(reply)` returns `(rgb uint8 H x W x 3, depth float32 H x W metres, NaN = no reading)`.

Errors: a malformed request answers `bad_params: ...`; a call outside the list answers `forbidden` (counted as an
illegal call); `episode_over` after the episode ended (`step` still answers, nothing moves). An internal error of the
cell while it answers a call that changes the cell ends the episode. When the cell failed in an episode (an internal
error, a physics fault, a frame it could not render: `camera_unavailable`, which is not charged to the frame budget),
the grader runs that episode once more from scratch, with a fresh cell and a fresh process of your program, and the
second run counts.

Budgets per episode (`describe()["budgets"]`): 1800 s of simulated time; 1200 s of **program time** (the wall clock
minus the cell's own time inside `step` and `get_camera`), 4x that in CPU seconds; 600 camera frames; 180 s of
silence (no request) ends the episode. After the episode is over the program may still read state and must finish.

No call returns ground truth.

**Commissioning** (`cell_manual.md` section 8; development only). The commissioning service answers the same calls on
the series' development sites, plus `reset(site)`, the first call of a connection: it starts the connection's one
shift on development site `site` (1-9) and answers `ok`, `site`, `site_name`, `shift` (its number in the window) and
`shifts_left`. `skidcell.client.connect_commissioning(site)` opens a connection and calls it. Errors: `bad_params` (no
such site), `no_shift` (a call before `reset`), `one_shift_per_connection`, `commissioning_window_used` (every shift of
the window is used), `busy` (as many shifts open as the service takes at a time). When a budget ends the shift the
service sends `{"id": null, "event": "shift_over", "reason": ...}` and closes the connection (the client raises
`CellError`). The commissioning window's count: `/run/skidcell/commission_status.json`. Nothing else differs from the
graded cell: no truth, no score, no debrief.
