# SOP-TD-01  Transfer and chlorine dosing skid: start-up, operation, shutdown

The skid transfers water from the supply tank T-101 to the product tank T-201 with the centrifugal pump P-101 and doses
sodium hypochlorite into T-201 with the metering pump P-301, which draws from dosing drum A (T-301, duty) or B (T-302,
standby). The consumer downstream draws from T-201. See `pid.png` for the process, `equipment_manual.md` for how each
device is built, operated and read.

**Tags.** This procedure, the P&ID and the equipment manual use the series tags (V-101, P-101, ...), the same on every
skid of the series. Each site numbers its equipment its own way: the tag plates and the control station's labels show
the **site tags**, and the site's **equipment list** (`describe()["site"]["equipment"]`) gives, for every series tag, the
site tag, the service and the start-up position. The log sheet takes the site tags.

All times are the cell's simulated clock (`sim_time`, seconds from the start of the shift).

| time | what |
|---|---|
| 0 s | shift start: the skid is in the shutdown state the previous shift left (not necessarily the one section 1 asks for) |
| 0 - 600 s | start-up (section 1): everything in section 1 done before the operating window opens |
| 600 s | the operating window opens; the consumer starts drawing from T-201 |
| 600 - 1500 s | operation (section 2) and the abnormal-situation procedures (section 3) |
| 1500 s | shift end: shut the skid down (section 4) |
| 1800 s | the episode ends (or earlier, when your program calls `finish`) |

## 1. Start-up

1.1 **Line-up.** Before P-101 is started, every valve must be in its line-up position. Check each one: the previous
shift may have left some of them elsewhere.

| tag | service | line-up position |
|---|---|---|
| V-101 | P-101 suction isolation | fully open |
| V-104 | minimum-flow return (to T-101) | fully open |
| V-103 | P-101 discharge isolation | closed |
| V-105 | product flow control | closed |
| V-107 | bypass of V-105 | closed |
| V-106 | T-101 make-up (bypass of T-101's float valve) | closed |
| V-111 | strainer changeover | chamber A in service |
| V-102 | P-101 casing vent | closed |
| V-112 | strainer chamber B vent | closed |
| V-302 | P-301 head vent | closed |
| V-303 | dosing suction selector | drum A |

1.2 **Prime P-101.** The pump casing was drained during maintenance. With V-101 open, open V-102: air escapes until
liquid stands in the sight glass VS-102 (about 12 s with V-102 fully open). Then close V-102. A pump started with air
in its casing is air-bound: it delivers little and its gauges' needles flutter; stop it, vent it and start it again.

1.3 **Start P-101.** Turn the selector HS-101 to HAND and press START (P-101). The RUN lamp lights; PI-103 rises to
the pump's shutoff pressure while the flow goes through the minimum-flow line only.

1.4 **Open V-103 fully** within 240 s of the start.

1.5 **Fill T-201.** Open V-105 to set the transfer (FI-105). Bring LG-201 into its band (55-75 %) by 600 s: the consumer
starts drawing at 600 s, at a rate no instrument shows (the level's trend shows it). The flow control valve is V-105;
its bypass V-107 stays closed.

1.6 **Start the dosing.** Press START (P-301) (P-301 runs only while P-101 runs) and set the needle valve V-301: more
open doses more. P-301 must be dosing when the window opens.

## 2. Operation (600 - 1500 s)

2.1 Hold **LG-201 between 55 and 75 %** (aim at 65 %): at a steady level the transfer equals the consumer's draw;
re-set V-105 when the level trends away. Never let T-201 reach 95 % (it overflows).

2.2 Hold the residual chlorine **AI-201 between 1.8 and 2.6 mg/L** (aim at 2.2): re-set V-301. AI-201 lags the tank by
about 20 s, and T-201 mixes over minutes: change V-301 in small steps and wait.

2.3 **Log sheet.** During the window, with P-101 running, record each instrument on the site's log sheet
(`describe()["site"]["log_sheet"]`: the site tags of PI-101, PI-103, PDI-111, FI-105, LG-201 and AI-201) once with
`log_reading(site_tag, value, unit)`, reading the value and the unit off the instrument itself. The first entry of each
tag in the window is the one on the sheet; it is checked against the instrument's true value at that moment (tolerance:
3 % of the instrument's span; LG-201 3 %; AI-201 0.05 mg/L). Units: bar, psi, kPa, m3/h, L/min, %, mg/L.

2.4 **Alarms.** The control station has one **COMMON ALARM** lamp: it lights while any of these lasts, and the horn
sounds (`get_state()["horn"]`) until RESET / ACK is pressed:
* the strainer's differential pressure PDI-111 above 0.6 bar;
* T-201's level LG-201 above 85 %;
* T-101's level LG-101 below 30 %.

The lamp does not say which: find the cause on the instruments (section 3). P-101's own trip lights its **FAULT**
lamp and sounds the horn too. Not every problem raises an alarm: watch the trends.

2.5 **Rounds.** Nothing on the panel shows the chlorine, the flows or the pressures: read the instruments where they
are, often enough to catch a trend (once the dosing stops, AI-201 falls by about 0.2-0.5 mg/L a minute, the faster
the higher the transfer).

## 3. Abnormal situations

**What to check first:**

| you see | check | then |
|---|---|---|
| COMMON ALARM, PI-101 falling, needles fluttering | PDI-111 high? | AOP-1 |
| COMMON ALARM, PI-101 falling | LG-101 low (T-101 emptying)? | AOP-5 |
| COMMON ALARM, LG-201 high | | reduce the transfer (V-105) at once |
| LG-201 drifting with no alarm | | AOP-2 |
| AI-201 falling while P-301 runs | drum A's level at the bottom (with V-303 at A)? | yes: AOP-4; no: AOP-3 |
| P-101 FAULT lamp, horn, no flow | | AOP-6 |

**AOP-1  Strainer differential pressure high** (PDI-111 above 0.6 bar). Within 240 s of the alarm:
1. fill and vent the standby chamber B: open V-112 until the sight glass VS-112 shows liquid (about 12 s), then close V-112;
2. turn the changeover V-111 from A to B (half a turn: its lever ends pointing at chamber B);
3. press RESET / ACK.

Switching to an unvented chamber pushes its air into the pump (air-bound). A clogged strainer starves the pump: it
cavitates (the suction gauge PI-101 falls, the pressure needles flutter, the flow drops); 300 s of cavitation in all
damages the pump.

**AOP-2  Demand change.** The consumer's draw may change during the window. When LG-201 trends away from 65 %, re-set V-105.
360 s after the change, LG-201 should be in its band and the transfer matched to the new draw: within 0.35 m3/h of it,
or up to 1 m3/h above (below) it while the level is being brought back up (down) to 65 %.

**AOP-3  Metering pump air-locked** (P-301 runs, drum A or B has liquid, but AI-201 keeps falling). Within 300 s:
1. press STOP (P-301);
2. open V-302 and keep it open at least 8 s;
3. close V-302;
4. press START (P-301).

Never open V-302 while P-301 runs: the hypochlorite leaves through the vent and nothing reaches T-201. The air lock is
in the pump's head: do not change drums for it. Venting does not help while the drum lined up is empty (AOP-4).

**AOP-4  Duty drum empty.** Drum A (T-301) is translucent: its level shows through its wall. When drum A runs dry, P-301
draws air and air-locks. Within 300 s of drum A running dry:
1. turn V-303 from A to B (half a turn: its lever ends pointing at the "B" plate);
2. if P-301 had drawn air, vent its head (AOP-3, steps 1-4).

Change over only once drum A is nearly empty (below 5 % of the drum) or dry: changing over while it still holds more
wastes the standby drum. Changing over in that last 5 %, before drum A runs dry, avoids the air lock and counts the same.

**AOP-5  Supply tank level low** (LG-101 below 30 %; T-101's float valve has stuck shut and the plant's supply no longer
refills T-101). Open the make-up valve V-106 (it bypasses the float valve) and hold T-101 between 40 and 80 % with it:
open it about as far as the transfer needs and re-set it as LG-101 trends. Act before T-101 runs down to about 8 %:
P-101 then trips on dry running. Never open V-106 while the float valve works: T-101 then overfills, and at 95 % it
overflows (the episode is void). When P-101 stops at the shift's end, close V-106.

**AOP-6  P-101 tripped** (P-101 FAULT lamp, the horn; a dip of the plant's power supply). P-301 stops with it. Within
180 s of the trip:
1. press RESET / ACK (the fault clears, the horn stops);
2. close V-103 (P-101 restarts against a closed discharge);
3. with HS-101 at HAND, press START (P-101);
4. open V-103 fully and re-set V-105 if the level needs it;
5. press START (P-301) (dosing again within 300 s of the trip).

## 4. Shutdown (after 1500 s)

In this order:
1. press STOP (P-301);
2. close V-103 fully;
3. press STOP (P-101);
4. close V-101 fully (and V-106 if it was opened in AOP-5);
5. turn HS-101 to OFF.

## 5. Never

Each of these ends the shift badly (the episode scores 0):
* running P-101 with no flow path (V-103 and V-104 both shut) for 30 s (deadheading: seal damage);
* 300 s of cavitation in all;
* T-201 or T-101 reaching 95 % (overflow);
* pressing the EMERGENCY STOP (no situation on this shift calls for it);
* the robot hitting the skid: more than 40 N for 30 ms on anything but a handle or a button, more than 150 N on a handle
  or a button.

Running P-101 with V-101 shut (or T-101 nearly empty) trips the motor protection after 5 s (FAULT lamp): remove the
cause, press RESET / ACK, start again. The selector at OFF or AUTO stops P-101 (AUTO is not available on this skid).

## 6. How the shift is scored

| part | weight | what counts |
|---|---|---|
| start-up | 0.20 | at the first start of P-101: the line-up of 1.1 (0.05) and a primed casing (0.04); a clean start: no trip and no deadheading in its first 120 s, still running then (0.04); V-103 fully open within 240 s of the start and before 600 s (0.04); P-301 dosing at 600 s (0.03) |
| operation | 0.25 | the fraction of the window with LG-201 in 55-75 % (0.125) and with AI-201 in 1.8-2.6 mg/L (0.125) |
| events | 0.25 | split equally between the window's events, the abnormal situations of section 3 that happen on the shift. AOP-2: in band and matched (or recovering towards 65 %) 360 s after the change. AOP-1: changed over within 240 s of the alarm (0.5 of the event), chamber B vented before (0.3), RESET after (0.2) (a slug that never raises the alarm in the window is not judged; changing over on the trend before the alarm counts as on time). AOP-3: dosing again within 300 s, from the drum that was lined up when the pump air-locked. AOP-4: V-303 turned to drum B once drum A was below 5 % (or dry), and dosing from drum B within 300 s of drum A running dry. AOP-5: V-106 opened before P-101 trips on dry running and no such trip until the shift ends (not judged if T-101 never reaches its low alarm). AOP-6: P-101 running again within 180 s (0.5), restarted with V-103 closed (0.25), dosing again within 300 s (0.25) |
| shutdown | 0.15 | after 1500 s: P-301 stopped before P-101 (0.03), V-103 closed before P-101 stops (0.04), P-101 stopped (0.03), V-101 closed at the end (0.03), HS-101 at OFF at the end (0.02) |
| log sheet | 0.15 | 0.025 for each of the six instruments of 2.3 recorded correctly |
